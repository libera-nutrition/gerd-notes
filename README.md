## DONTs
1. Do not use proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medicines for more than a few weeks or months. Do not use it at all for acid reflux. Examples of PPIs are omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, etc. The reason is that they gradually cause damage to numerous organs with extended use. Eventually this can expect to show in abnormal blood results as detriorated kidney function via elevated BUN and creatinine, etc. The abnormalities may show faster with stronger PPIs. PPIs are okay to use only in the short term, such as for treating an esophegeal ulcer that is not responding to other treatment, or perhaps as a part of an H. pylori treatment protocol, etc.
2. Contrary to popular advice, consider not raising the head of your bed at all. Although raising the head while sleeping does help with acid reflux while in bed, it absolutely can misalign the spine, resulting in chronic lower back pain which subsequently also manifests as referred leg pain.
