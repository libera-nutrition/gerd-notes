## DONTs
1. Do not use proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medicines for more than a few weeks or months. Do not use it at all for acid reflux. Examples of PPIs are omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, etc. The reason is that they gradually cause damage to numerous organs with extended use. Eventually this can expect to show in abnormal blood results as detriorated kidney function via elevated BUN and creatinine, etc. The abnormalities may show faster with stronger PPIs. PPIs are okay to use only in the short term, such as for treating an esophegeal ulcer that is not responding to other treatment, or perhaps as a part of an H. pylori treatment protocol, etc. Safe alternatives to PPIs are H2RAs and are documented.
2. Do not use most over-the-counter antacid tablets with calcium carbonate. The reason is that these tablets always contain sugar-like additives that cause dental disease which also worsens overall health due to the slow leakage of bacteria from the mouth into the blood. The prominent such additives are dextrose, starch, and maltodextrin. Even the simple peppermint flavor formulation contains such additives. Flavored variants of the tables can also contain artificial colors which are linked to inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, all such tablets are also expected to contain one or more artificial sweeteners such as sucralose, etc. that risk gut dysbiosis, with the possibility of worsening reflux due to this dysbiosis. The safe alternative to these antacid tablets is pure calcium carbonate powder, also magnesium carbonate powder to a lesser extent.
3. Do not consume specific supplements that may significantly worsen reflux, although the experience can be personal. These supplements can sometimes exist in a product that contains a blend, in which case the blend has to be discontinued. A possible example of such a supplement is R5P, and it can generally be replaced by riboflavin.
4. Contrary to popular advice for acid reflux, consider not raising the head of your bed at all. Although raising the head while sleeping does help with acid reflux while in bed, it absolutely can misalign the spine, resulting in chronic lower back pain which subsequently also manifests as referred leg pain.
